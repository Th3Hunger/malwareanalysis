Hello World, This Will Probably be My First Malware Report Where I will Reverse Ryuk Ransomware. So Before Getting into Technical Analysis and Reverse Engineering I will Provide Some Introduction to Ryuk. So The Typical Attack Flow of Ryuk is as Follows:

1- An maldoc Contains a malicious macro that will execute PowerShell. 

2- The PowerShell Command then Installs Emotet Banking Trojan. 

3- Emotet Then Downloads TrickBot 

4- As A Typical Lateral Movement Activity TrickBot Downloads Ryuk 

5- Ryuk Then Tries to Encrypt all the Network Hosts 

Who Created It ? 
--------------------

So Attribution is Hard However From What I have Read Threat Intel Researches Suggest that it belongs to the Authors of HERMES which is a Ransomware first was detected in October 2017 was then arrtributed to an APT Group Called Lazarus Group.

- The Name of the Dropped Exe are Seven Random Charachters. 
- The Malware Injects Into 4 Process taskeng.exe, host.exe, dwm.exe, ctfmon.exe
- The Malware Deletes its Shadow Copies Using:
        cmd /c \"WMIC.exe shadowcopy delet\
        vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /all /quiet
As You Can See a Typo Found in the First Command The Author Missed 'e' in delete.
