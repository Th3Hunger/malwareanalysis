Hello World, This Will Probably be My First Malware Report Where I will Reverse Ryuk Ransomware. So Before Getting into Technical Analysis and Reverse Engineering I will Provide Some Introduction to Ryuk. So The Typical Attack Flow of Ryuk is as Follows:



1- An maldoc Contains a malicious macro that will execute PowerShell. 

2- The PowerShell Command then Installs Emotet Banking Trojan. 

3- Emotet Then Downloads TrickBot 

4- As A Typical Lateral Movement Activity TrickBot Downloads Ryuk 

5- Ryuk Then Tries to Encrypt all the Network Hosts
